### About the Experiment 

The "Cell Organization and Sub Cellular Structure Studies (Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic)" module, part of the Cell Biology Virtual Lab I at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, offers an interactive platform for students to explore fundamental cell biology concepts. This virtual lab guides users through the processes of specimen preparation, fixation, and staining, essential for light microscopic examination of cells. By simulating both heat and chemical fixation techniques, along with simple staining methods, the lab enhances understanding of cellular structures and morphology in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. This educational tool is designed to reinforce theoretical knowledge through practical, hands-on virtual experiments.â€‹
